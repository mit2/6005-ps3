The purpose of this problem set is to explore multithreaded programming with a shared mutable data type, which you should protect using synchronization.
You will start with some minimal server code and implement a server and thread-safe data structure for playing a multiplayer variant of the classic computer game “Minesweeper.”

You can review the traditional single-player Minesweeper concept rules on Wikipedia: Minesweeper (video game)

You can try playing traditional/single-player Minesweeper here.
